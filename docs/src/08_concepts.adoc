== Design Concepts and Decisions

=== Architectural Patterns and Principles

The system follows a microservices architecture, ensuring modularity and scalability:

Service Layering:

Independent Services: Each microservice is responsible for a specific domain, handling its own data and business logic.
API Gateway: Manages communication between services and external clients, ensuring secure and efficient data flow.
Frontend Integration: The user interface consumes APIs from multiple microservices, allowing for a flexible and decoupled design.
This approach enhances scalability, maintainability, and component reusability, facilitating independent development and deployment of services.

=== Key Architectural Decisions

Starting from Scratch with Reference to Previous Projects:
The decision was made to develop the system from scratch, leveraging the knowledge and experiences from last year's projects. This allowed for the design of a more efficient and flexible architecture without the constraints of previous versions.

Use of Modern Technologies:
Technologies such as React for the interface, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the database have been chosen, ensuring an agile development process adaptable to the project's needs.

As development progresses, more key decisions and their justifications will be documented.
