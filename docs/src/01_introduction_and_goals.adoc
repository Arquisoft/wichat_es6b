ChattySw has been hired by RTVE to improve an online quiz game inspired by "Saber y Ganar." The previous version was developed by HappySw.

The new version, WIChat, lets users identify locations from images and answer related questions. A key feature is the ability to get hints through a conversational AI model.

=== Requirements Overview

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Short description of the functional requirements, driving forces, extract (or abstract)
of requirements. Link to (hopefully existing) requirements documents
(with version number and information where to find it).

.Motivation
From the point of view of the end users a system is created or modified to
improve support of a business activity and/or improve the quality.

.Form
Short textual description, probably in tabular use-case format.
If requirements documents exist this overview should refer to these documents.

Keep these excerpts as short as possible. Balance readability of this document with potential redundancy w.r.t to requirements documents.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-1/[Introduction and Goals] in the arc42 documentation.

endif::arc42help[]
- Users must be able to register, log in, and manage their accounts.
- The system must present images and corresponding quiz questions.
- Users must be able to submit answers within a set time limit.
- A conversational AI must provide hints when requested.
- The system must track user performance and maintain historical data.
- Questions, answers, and hints must be generated automatically from Wikidata.
- APIs must be available for accessing user data and quiz content.


=== Quality Goals

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
The top three (max five) quality goals for the architecture whose fulfillment is of highest importance to the major stakeholders. 
We really mean quality goals for the architecture. Don't confuse them with project goals.
They are not necessarily identical.

Consider this overview of potential topics (based upon the ISO 25010 standard):

image::01_2_iso-25010-topics-EN.drawio.png["Categories of Quality Requirements"]

.Motivation
You should know the quality goals of your most important stakeholders, since they will influence fundamental architectural decisions. 
Make sure to be very concrete about these qualities, avoid buzzwords.
If you as an architect do not know how the quality of your work will be judged...

.Form
A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities

=== Stakeholders

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Explicit overview of stakeholders of the system, i.e. all person, roles or organizations that

* should know the architecture
* have to be convinced of the architecture
* have to work with the architecture or with code
* need the documentation of the architecture for their work
* have to come up with decisions about the system or its development

.Motivation
You should know all parties involved in development of the system or affected by the system.
Otherwise, you may get nasty surprises later in the development process.
These stakeholders determine the extent and the level of detail of your work and its results.

.Form
Table with role names, person names, and their expectations with respect to the architecture and its documentation.
