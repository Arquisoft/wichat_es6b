== Building Block View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The building block view shows the static decomposition of the system into building blocks (modules, components, subsystems, classes, interfaces, packages, libraries, frameworks, layers, partitions, tiers, functions, macros, operations, data structures, ...) as well as their dependencies (relationships, associations, ...)

This view is mandatory for every architecture documentation.
In analogy to a house this is the _floor plan_.

.Motivation
Maintain an overview of your source code by making its structure understandable through
abstraction.

This allows you to communicate with your stakeholder on an abstract level without disclosing implementation details.

.Form
The building block view is a hierarchical collection of black boxes and white boxes
(see figure below) and their descriptions.

image::05_building_blocks-EN.png["Hierarchy of building blocks"]

*Level 1* is the white box description of the overall system together with black
box descriptions of all contained building blocks.

*Level 2* zooms into some building blocks of level 1.
Thus it contains the white box description of selected building blocks of level 1, together with black box descriptions of their internal building blocks.

*Level 3* zooms into selected building blocks of level 2, and so on.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-5/[Building Block View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Whitebox Overall System

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Here you describe the decomposition of the overall system using the following white box template. It contains

 * an overview diagram
 * a motivation for the decomposition
 * black box descriptions of the contained building blocks. For these we offer you alternatives:

   ** use _one_ table for a short and pragmatic overview of all contained building blocks and their interfaces
   ** use a list of black box descriptions of the building blocks according to the black box template (see below).
   Depending on your choice of tool this list could be sub-chapters (in text files), sub-pages (in a Wiki) or nested elements (in a modeling tool).


 * (optional:) important interfaces, that are not explained in the black box templates of a building block, but are very important for understanding the white box.
Since there are so many ways to specify interfaces why do not provide a specific template for them.
 In the worst case you have to specify and describe syntax, semantics, protocols, error handling,
 restrictions, versions, qualities, necessary compatibilities and many things more.
In the best case you will get away with examples or simple signatures.

Motivation::

The system consists of a game (Saber y ganar) in which the user interacts with the application to answer questions.


Contained Building Blocks::
[cols="2,5", options="header"]
|===
| **Name**            | **Responsibility**  
| **Usuario**         | Interacts with the application via the frontend.  
| **Frontend (React)** | Provides the user interface where users interact with the system.  
| **Backend (Node.js)** | Manages business logic, handles frontend requests, and communicates with the database.  
| **MongoDB**         | NoSQL database used for storing user, race, and registration data.  
| **Docker**          | Containerization platform ensuring portability and scalability of services.

=== Scope and Context

The system is a question-and-answer game inspired by *Saber y Ganar*. It aims to offer an educational and entertaining user experience by combining modern technologies such as language models and open knowledge sources.

The main building blocks of the system are:

- **MongoDB**: Stores all persistent data, including user credentials, gameplay history, scores, and response times.

- **LLM (Large Language Model)**: Generates contextual hints to assist the user in answering questions. It enhances the game experience through natural language processing.

- **Wikidata**: Serves as the main external data source for questions and answers. It provides structured, reliable, and up-to-date content for the game.

=== Level 1: General System Interaction

image::Nivel1.png["Vista nivel 1"]

At this level, we explore how the main components interact within the system:

- The **user** interacts with the **frontend**, which serves as the visual interface of the game.

- The **frontend** communicates with the **LLM** to request and display hints during the game.

- The **backend** handles both:
  - The **user data**, by interacting with the database (MongoDB).
  - The **game content**, by fetching questions and answers from **Wikidata**.

In summary:
1. The user accesses the game through the frontend.
2. The frontend sends requests to the backend, which acts as the system's coordinator.
3. The backend fetches questions from Wikidata and manages user data in MongoDB.
4. Hints are generated by the LLM and delivered to the frontend via a dedicated interaction.

=== Level 2: Internal Components and Control Flow

image::Nivel2.png["Vista nivel 2"]

This level provides a more detailed view of the internal architecture and the flow of data between components:

- The **User** interacts with a central **Gateway**, which acts as the main controller for the entire system.  
  All communication flows through the Gateway, ensuring centralized routing and access control.

- The **Frontend** contains a key module called **Game**, responsible for:
  * Displaying questions and collecting user responses.
  * Requesting contextual hints from the LLM.
  * Communicating exclusively with the Gateway.

- The **Backend** is composed of several core modules, grouped under the **User Module**, which is responsible for managing all user-related operations:

  * **Authentication Service**  
    Verifies user credentials and ensures secure login.

  * **Authorization Service**  
    Controls user permissions and enforces role-based access.

  * **History Service**  
    Records gameplay activity, including results, answer accuracy, and response times.

- **External Services** integrated into the system:
  * **LLM API** – The Game module (via the Gateway) interacts with the LLM to retrieve intelligent hints.
  * **Wikidata API** – The Backend accesses Wikidata to dynamically retrieve question-and-answer content used in the game.
