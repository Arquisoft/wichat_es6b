== Deployment View

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Content
The deployment view describes:

 1. technical infrastructure used to execute your system, with infrastructure elements like geographical locations, environments, computers, processors, channels and net topologies as well as other infrastructure elements and

2. mapping of (software) building blocks to that infrastructure elements.

Often systems are executed in different environments, e.g. development environment, test environment, production environment. In such cases you should document all relevant environments.

Especially document a deployment view if your software is executed as distributed system with more than one computer, processor, server or container or when you design and construct your own hardware processors and chips.

From a software perspective it is sufficient to capture only those elements of an infrastructure that are needed to show a deployment of your building blocks. Hardware architects can go beyond that and describe an infrastructure to any level of detail they need to capture.

.Motivation
Software does not run without hardware.
This underlying infrastructure can and will influence a system and/or some
cross-cutting concepts. Therefore, there is a need to know the infrastructure.

.Form

Maybe a highest level deployment diagram is already contained in section 3.2. as
technical context with your own infrastructure as ONE black box. In this section one can
zoom into this black box using additional deployment diagrams:

* UML offers deployment diagrams to express that view. Use it, probably with nested diagrams,
when your infrastructure is more complex.
* When your (hardware) stakeholders prefer other kinds of diagrams rather than a deployment diagram, let them use any kind that is able to show nodes and channels of the infrastructure.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-7/[Deployment View] in the arc42 documentation.

=== Infrastructure Level 1

ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
Describe (usually in a combination of diagrams, tables, and text):

* distribution of a system to multiple locations, environments, computers, processors, .., as well as physical connections between them
* important justifications or motivations for this deployment structure
* quality and/or performance features of this infrastructure
* mapping of software artifacts to elements of this infrastructure

For multiple environments or alternative deployments please copy and adapt this section of arc42 for all relevant environments.

Motivation::

Having independent services deployed on the same machine give a lot of flexibility at deciding where the application will be deployed, making possible to have only a virtual machine to run the whole application.

Quality and/or Performance Features::

By our experience, we estimate that Azure VM with 2 GiB RAM and 1vCPU could work perfectly.

Mapping of Building Blocks to Infrastructure::
|===
| Element | Description
|Client| The client will always be a web browser such as Safari or Firefox, by a HTTP request. 
| WebApp | This is the frontend of the application. THe function of the game does not need to store information, everything is dynamic, so there is no need is having the game in an independent service.
| Gateway | The gateway service contain all the information required to users: their account, the scores they had and so on. These modules connect to the same database, a mongoDB located at the same machine as the application, but not being part of it.
| Questions | This service connects with de Wikidata API, and requests some types of questions known by our application.
| Wikidata | Service where questions are collected. SparQL is required to use the API
| LLM | The LLM decided to support hint requests are Mistral and Gemini. The idea is to give a prompt with the context of how to answer client questions with hints.
|===

Every interaction between services is done by HTTP requests, and they have defined their own ports on the same machine:
|===
|Element|Port
|Webapp | 3000
|Gateway Service| 8000
|User Service | 8001
|Auth Service | 8002
|LLM Service | 8003
|History Service | 8004
|Questions Service | 8010
|WebApp | 3000
