== Test Report

In this project, tests have been carried out for each created service and for every React component.  
Since Continuous Integration and Development was chosen, these tests are executed every time something is added to the `master` branch, whether through commits or pull requests.  
Additionally, when a release is made, the acceptance tests are also executed, ensuring compliance with Continuous Integration and Development.

=== Unit Tests

This project consists of 7 services: Gateway, llmService, questionsService, authservice, historyservice, usersService, webapp

==== Gateway Test

Tests API Gateway functionality by verifying request routing between services, authentication middleware, and error handling. Includes endpoint validation for /login, /adduser, /stats, /rankings, and /history, plus health checks.

==== llmService Test

These tests verify that the service responds as expected when the parameters are correct, as well as when there is an error in the parameters â€” for example, if a parameter is missing, if a non-existent LLM model is selected, or if the POST request fails.

==== questionsService Test

Validates WikiData integration for trivia question generation, testing category filtering, multilingual support, and question format. Ensures proper handling of API responses and errors.

==== authservice Test

Verifies user authentication including JWT tokens, login process, and password encryption. Tests token validation, session management, and security features.

==== historyservice Test

Checks game record management by testing storage of results, statistics retrieval, and ranking calculations. Validates data consistency and error handling.

==== usersService Test

Tests user management features including registration, username validation, and MongoDB interactions. Verifies user data handling and profile operations.

==== webapp Test
Validates frontend UI components using React Testing Library. Tests component rendering, user interactions, and state management for login, game interface, and profile views.

=== Code Coverage

From the unit tests, we can analyze the project's code coverage.  
For this purpose, SonarQube's test coverage feature was used, achieving **85.4% test coverage**.

=== Load Tests

Artillery was used for load testing. The following endpoints were tested: `/login`, `/adduser`, `/generateQuestions` (start game), `/history/{{username}}`, `/savegame`, and `/stats/{{username}}`.

A total of 2280 users were created, and 15,960 HTTP requests were made, with an average rate of 74 responses per second.

The load tests lasted 4 minutes and were divided into 3 phases: an initial ramp-up (7 U/s to 60 U/s), a medium load phase (100 U/s), and a peak load phase (100 U/s to 185 U/s).  
The highest response time recorded was 2.7 seconds, with an average response time of 65 ms.

image::httpPerfor.png["HTTP performance"]

For the `/adduser` request, a 200 status code is returned when a user is created for the first time; subsequent attempts return a 400 code.

The `/generateQuestions`, `/history/{{username}}`, `/savegame`, and `/stats/{{username}}` requests all return 200 status codes, as they are called with valid data.

image::requestURL.png["URL requests"]

For the `/login` request, about half return 401 status codes due to unregistered users, while the other half return 200 codes with correct credentials.  
This endpoint also showed the highest response time when the number of concurrent users was at its peak.

All the tests, as well as instructions on how to execute them and how to visualize the graphs in a more dynamic way, can be found in the `testCarga` directory.
