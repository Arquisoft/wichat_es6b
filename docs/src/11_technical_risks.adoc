.Contents
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/[Risks and Technical Debt] in the arc42 documentation.

| **Risk** | **Explanation** | **Measure**
| Lack of experience with the technologies used | We lack extensive experience with technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, which might complicate their usage. | Research these technologies and learn how to use them correctly.
| Lack of time | There are deadlines for each deliverable, and we may run out of time. | Stay consistent and do as much as possible daily.
| Teamwork challenges | Working in a team can be difficult, especially since we've never done a large project like this. | Maintain good communication and collaboration.
| Unproductive meetings | Spending too much time in meetings without making progress can cause issues. | Prepare briefly for meetings to focus on specific topics.
| Member abandonment | If a team member quits, their tasks will need to be reassigned, increasing the workload. | Assign tasks to multiple people and offer support to avoid abandonment.
| External service failure | An external service like Wikidata or Azure may fail temporarily. | Stay updated on service changes and work to restore functionality quickly.

| **Technical Debt** | **Description** 

| Usability errors | The application has usability issues, such as the ranking table not adapting well to smaller screen sizes or limited space. This can lead to a poor user experience, especially on mobile devices.
| Button disabling issues | There is a risk of all buttons being disabled simultaneously, which can block user interaction and disrupt the flow of the application.
| Misplaced settings tab | The settings tab was added to the navigation bar, but it should also have been included when starting a game. This inconsistency can confuse users and reduce accessibility to important settings.
