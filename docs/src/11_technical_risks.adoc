== Risks and Technical Debts


ifdef::arc42help[]
[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
A list of identified technical risks or technical debts, ordered by priority

.Motivation
“Risk management is project management for grown-ups” (Tim Lister, Atlantic Systems Guild.) 

This should be your motto for systematic detection and evaluation of risks and technical debts in the architecture, which will be needed by management stakeholders (e.g. project managers, product owners) as part of the overall risk analysis and measurement planning.

.Form
List of risks and/or technical debts, probably including suggested measures to minimize, mitigate or avoid risks or reduce technical debts.


.Further Information

See https://docs.arc42.org/section-11/[Risks and Technical Debt] in the arc42 documentation.

| **Risk** | **Explanation** | **Measure**
| Lack of experience with the technologies used | We lack extensive experience with technologies like React, Node.js, MongoDB, which might complicate their usage. | Research these technologies and learn how to use them correctly.
| Lack of time | There are deadlines for each deliverable, and we may run out of time. | Stay consistent and do as much as possible daily.
| Teamwork challenges | Working in a team can be difficult, especially since we've never done a large project like this. | Maintain good communication and collaboration.
| Unproductive meetings | Spending too much time in meetings without making progress can cause issues. | Prepare briefly for meetings to focus on specific topics.
| Member abandonment | If a team member quits, their tasks will need to be reassigned, increasing the workload. | Assign tasks to multiple people and offer support to avoid abandonment.
| External service failure | An external service like Wikidata or Azure may fail temporarily. | Stay updated on service changes and work to restore functionality quickly.

| **Technical Debt** | **Explanation** | **Solution**
| Insufficient documentation | Lack of proper documentation can make future system understanding and maintenance challenging. | Ensure thorough and clear documentation is created.
| Suboptimal database design | A poorly designed database can create scalability issues as the system grows. | Plan and design the database carefully before implementation or modification.
| Dependence on AI-generated code | AI-generated code may have inaccuracies, potentially leading to difficulties when revisiting or updating it. | Review, adjust, and validate AI-generated code before integration.
| LLM performance issues | The language model may cause slow response times and irrelevant answers, impacting user experience. | Optimize prompts and continuously monitor the model's performance for improvements.
